    ```json
    {
      "goal_id": "goal-abcdef123456",
      "status": "PROCESSING",
      "message": "Your goal has been accepted and is being deconstructed by the Agent-Manager."
    }
    ```
  - **`400 Bad Request`**: The request body is missing the `description` field.

      "status": "COMPLETED",
      "results": [
        {
          "contract_type": "IMAGE",
          "submission_data": "images/final_poster.png",

          "winning_agent_id": "agent-copywriter-042"
