# KratosNOVA - API Design

This document describes the REST API for the KratosNOVA MVP. The API is the primary interface for user interaction and for agents to participate in the market.

**Base URL:** `https://<your-api-id>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/`

---

## 1. Create a New Goal

Starts the entire KratosNOVA process. The user submits a high-level goal, which is then picked up by the Agent-Manager.

- **Endpoint:** `/goals`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Description:** Submits a new goal for the agent economy to solve.
- **Request Body:**

  ```json
  {
    "description": "An indie sci-fi movie named 'Echoes of Jupiter'"
  }
  ```

- **Responses:**

  - **`202 Accepted`** - The goal has been successfully accepted and is being processed. The response includes an ID to track the progress.

    ```json
    {
      "goal_id": "goal-abcdef123456",
      "status": "PROCESSING",
      "message": "Your goal has been accepted and is being deconstructed by the Agent-Manager."
    }
    ```

  - **`400 Bad Request`** - The request body is missing the `description` field or is malformed.

    }
    ```

  - **`200 OK`** (Completed) - The process is complete and the final results are included.
